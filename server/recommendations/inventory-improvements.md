# Inventory Management Improvements

## 1. Real-time Inventory Reservations

- Prevent overselling with atomic operations

## 2. Advanced Reorder Logic

```javascript
// Enhanced reorder calculation
calculateReorderPoint(product) {
  const leadTime = product.supplierLeadTime || 7; // days
  const dailyUsage = product.averageDailyUsage || 1;
  const safetyStock = product.safetyStockDays || 3;

  return (leadTime + safetyStock) * dailyUsage;
}
```

## 3. Inventory Valuation Methods

- Implement FIFO, LIFO, and Weighted Average costing
- Add inventory aging reports
- Track inventory holding costs

## 4. Cycle Counting

- Implement automated cycle counting schedules
- Track inventory accuracy metrics
- Generate variance reports
