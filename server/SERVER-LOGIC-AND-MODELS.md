## Core Business Logic & Flows

### 1. Inventory Supply

- Adds new stock via batches, updates inventory and item records.
- Records cost, total, and purchase order linkage.
- Audit log entry created.

### 2. Mark Damaged Inventory

- Marks items as damaged, calculates and logs financial loss.
- Updates item status/history and audit log.

### 3. Sales/Dispatch

- Deducts inventory and marks items as dispatched.
- Calculates COGS and profit for each sale.
- Updates inventory value and logs audit.

### 4. Purchase, Sales, Payment Flows

- Full CRUD for purchase orders, invoices, payments, sales orders, sales invoices, and payments received.
- All financial actions are logged.

### 5. Reporting

- Endpoints for:
  - Inventory value by warehouse/product
  - COGS and profit/loss over a period
  - Outstanding payables/receivables
  - Value of damaged/lost inventory

### 6. Validation & Security

- All sensitive endpoints require authentication and proper roles (admin, finance, sales, etc).
- All financial fields are validated for presence and positivity.

### 7. Testing

- Automated Jest tests for all major endpoints and flows.

## Recommendations for Further Robustness

- Add stock reservation/allocation logic.
- Implement manual stock adjustment/audit endpoints.
- Enhance returns/reverse logistics handling.
- Add support for stock transfers between locations.
- Implement expiry management and notifications.
- Expand edge-case and integration tests.
- Add API rate limiting and monitoring for production.
