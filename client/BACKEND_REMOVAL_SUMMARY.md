# Backend Integration Removal Summary

## Overview

All backend integrations have been successfully removed from the SmartStock client application. The application now uses mock data and placeholder functions instead of actual API calls.

## Changes Made

### 1. Redux Slices Updated

- **authSlice.js**: Removed axios calls, replaced with mock login/logout functions
- **productSlice.js**: Removed API calls, replaced with mock product data
- **userSlice.js**: Removed API calls, replaced with mock user management functions
- **inventorySlice.js**: Removed API calls, replaced with mock inventory data
- **supplierSlice.js**: Removed API calls, replaced with mock supplier data

### 2. Configuration Files

- **config/config.js**: Updated API base URL to placeholder
- **constants/index.js**: Updated API_CONFIG.BASE_URL to placeholder

### 3. Services

- **httpClient.js**: Simplified to remove complex backend-specific interceptors
- **api.js**: Empty (was already empty)
- **auth.js**: Empty (was already empty)

### 4. Components Updated

- **AdminDashboard.jsx**: Removed backend API calls, replaced with mock data
- **AdminUserManagement.jsx**: Removed backend API calls, replaced with mock functions
- **ExternalUserManagement.jsx**: Removed backend API calls, replaced with mock functions
- **ProductManagement.jsx**: Removed backend API calls, replaced with mock functions
- **ReturnsManagement.jsx**: Removed backend API calls, replaced with mock functions
- **AIAssistantPage.jsx**: Removed backend API calls, replaced with mock data

### 5. Files Backed Up

Original files were backed up with `.old.js` extension:

- `authSlice.old.js`
- `productSlice.old.js`
- `userSlice.old.js`
- `inventorySlice.old.js`
- `supplierSlice.old.js`
- `httpClient.old.js`

## Mock Data Structure

### Authentication

- Mock login with predefined user data
- Token stored in localStorage
- Basic role-based access (admin, staff, etc.)

### Products

- Sample products with basic properties (name, SKU, price, category)
- Mock CRUD operations

### Users

- Sample users with different roles
- Mock user management operations

### Inventory

- Sample inventory data with batches
- Mock supply management operations

### Suppliers

- Sample supplier data
- Mock supplier management operations

## Integration Points for New Backend

All TODO comments have been added where backend integration is needed:

```javascript
// TODO: Replace with new backend API call
```

### Key Integration Points:

1. **Authentication**: Login/logout endpoints
2. **User Management**: CRUD operations for users
3. **Product Management**: CRUD operations for products
4. **Inventory Management**: Supply tracking and management
5. **Supplier Management**: External user management
6. **Returns Management**: Return processing
7. **Dashboard Data**: Analytics and statistics
8. **AI Assistant**: Prediction and analysis data

## Next Steps

1. **Set up new backend**: Configure your new backend server
2. **Update API URLs**: Replace placeholder URLs with actual backend endpoints
3. **Replace mock functions**: Implement actual API calls in Redux slices
4. **Update authentication**: Implement proper JWT token handling
5. **Add error handling**: Implement proper error handling for API failures
6. **Test integration**: Verify all endpoints work correctly

## Files Still Using Mock Data

The following files now use mock data and will need to be updated when integrating with the new backend:

- All Redux slices in `src/app/slices/`
- All management components in `src/components/features/`
- Dashboard and analytics pages
- Configuration files

## Important Notes

- The application will still run and function normally with mock data
- All UI components and state management remain intact
- Authentication flow works with mock credentials
- Data persistence is local (localStorage) only
- No actual API calls are being made

The client is now ready for integration with your new backend system!
