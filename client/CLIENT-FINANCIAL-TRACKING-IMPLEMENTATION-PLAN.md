  - `financialReportService.js`
  - `auditLogService.js`
- **Implement CRUD and reporting methods** in each, matching the new server endpoints.

## 2. UI Pages & Components

  - Purchase Orders (list, create, view, edit)
  - Invoices (list, create, view, edit)
  - Payments (list, record, view)
  - Sales Orders & Sales Invoices (list, create, view, edit)
  - Financial Reports (inventory value, COGS/profit, payables, receivables, damaged/lost value)
  - Audit Log (view/filter actions)
- **Create reusable components:**
  - Financial entity forms (PO, invoice, payment, etc.)

  - Reporting dashboards and charts

## 5. Reporting & Analytics

- Add export/download options for reports.

## 6. Testing

## 7. Implementation Roadmap

1. Scaffold new service files and API methods.
2. Build UI pages and reusable components for financial entities.
3. Integrate new features into existing pages.
4. Implement role-based UI logic.
5. Develop reporting dashboards.
6. Write and run tests for all new features.
